## Introduction

Vulkron is a cross-platform renderer built on Vulkan for high-performance graphics. It supports development and execution on both Windows and Linux, using Conda to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment across platforms.

Shaders are authored in Slang, a modern and flexible shading language that enables expressive, efficient programmable effects. By leveraging Vulkan's low-level control alongside Slang's high-level capabilities, Vulkron serves as a foundation for graphics experimentation, engine development, and much more.

## Dependencies

### System Dependencies

- **Vulkan SDK**
- **Up-to-date GPU drivers**
- **Miniconda3**
- **Python 3.8+**

### Conda Will Install

| Package       | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `cmake`       | Build system for C++ projects          |
| `ninja`       | Fast, parallel build system (optional) |
| `clang`       | Project compiler for C++23             |
| `shader-slang`| Shader authoring and compilation       |

## Build Process

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
mkdir vulkron-source
cd vulkron-source
git clone https://github.com/bisqottii/Vulkron.git
cd Vulkron
```

### 2. Configure the Conda Environment

This step installs all required development dependencies using Conda.

> **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you have conda in the default location, otherwise, you'll have to update the paths in the config files.

#### Linux
```bash
source build-scripts/linux/conda_config.sh
```

#### Windows

PowerShell may block the execution of local scripts. Before running the setup, allow script execution for the current session:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\build-scripts\windows\conda_config.ps1
```

**What the script does:**

- Checks for an existing Miniconda installation
- Creates a Conda environment named `vk-env` if it doesn't exist
- Installs all required dependencies into the environment
- Activates the environment for the current shell session

**When to use it:**  
Run this script after cloning the repository and before building Vulkron. It ensures a consistent development environment without manual dependency management.

> There is also a separate `conda_activate` script to reactivate your environment later if needed.

### 3. Build the Project

From the `Vulkron/` directory, use the provided Python build scripts:

```bash
python build-scripts/build.py --help
```

To install the project locally:

```bash
python build-scripts/install.py
```

To build and install examples first call `install.py` then:
```bash
python build-scripts/example.py
```

**Build location:**  
The build is out-of-source, located in `../vulkron-build/` relative to the `Vulkron/` directory.

**Available targets:**

- `VulkronGPU` – GPU library
- `VulkronUI` – UI and Platform library

If no target is specified, all executables are built.

## VS Code IntelliSense Configuration

To enable proper IntelliSense for Vulkan and Clang, create `.vscode/settings.json` at the workspace root (same level as your out-of-source build folder):

```json
{
    "C_Cpp.default.compileCommands": "${workspaceFolder}/build/debug/compile_commands.json",
    "cmake.sourceDirectory": "${workspaceFolder}/Vulkron"
}
```

This configuration allows IntelliSense to use the compiler flags and include paths generated by CMake, ensuring accurate autocomplete and type checking without manual path or define management.
